* !ignore IDENT PATTERN, !ig IDENT PATTERN: add an ignore pattern

    > !ig 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b obnoxious\?foo=\d+
    < Added ignore pattern obnoxious\?foo=\d+ to job
      1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b.

  The pattern must be expressed as regular expressions.  For more
  information, see:

  http://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto
  http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax


* !unignore IDENT PATTERN, !unig IDENT PATTERN: remove an ignore pattern

* !ignoreset IDENT NAME, !igset IDENT NAME: add a set of ignore patterns

    > !igset 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b blogs
    < Added 17 ignore patterns to job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b.

  You may specify multiple ignore sets.  Ignore sets that are unknown
  are, well, ignored:

    > !igset 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b blogs, other
    < Added 17 ignore patterns to job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b.
    < The following sets are unknown: other

  Ignore set definitions can be found under db/ignore_patterns/.


* !delay IDENT MIN MAX, !d IDENT MIN MAX: set inter-request delay

    > !delay 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b 500 750
    < Inter-request delay for job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b set to [500,
      750 ms].

  Delays may be any non-negative number, and are interpreted as
  milliseconds.  The default inter-request delay range is [250, 375] ms.


* !reqdelay IDENT MIN MAX, !reqd IDENT MIN MAX: set page requisite delay

    > !reqdelay 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b 500 750
    < Page requisite delay for job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b set to [500,
      750 ms].

  Page requisites include most assets linked from the page, e.g. images,
  CSS, and linked <object>s.  (It does not include any assets loaded by
  code executed in linked <object>s, though.)

  Delays may be any non-negative number, and are interpreted as
  milliseconds.  The default page requisite delay range is [25, 100] ms.


* !concurrency IDENT LEVEL, !con IDENT LEVEL: set concurrency level

    > !concurrency 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b 8
    < Job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b set to use 8 workers.

  Adding additional workers may speed up grabs if the target site has
  capacity to spare, but it also puts additional pressure on the target.
  Use wisely.


* !yahoo IDENT: set zero second delays, crank concurrency to 11

    > !yahoo 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b
    < Inter-request delay for job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b set to
      [0, 0] ms.
    < Page requisite delay for job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b set to
      [0, 0] ms.
    < Job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b set to use 11 workers.

  Only recommended for use when archiving data from hosts with gobs of
  bandwidth and processing power (e.g. Yahoo, Google, Amazon).  Keep in
  mind that this is likely to trigger any rate limiters that the target
  may have.


* !expire IDENT: for expiring jobs, expire a job immediately

    > !expire 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b
    < Job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b expired.

  In rare cases, the 48 hour timeout enforced by ArchiveBot on archive
  jobs is too long.  This command permits faster snapshotting.  It
  should be used sparingly; abuse is very easy to spot.

  If a job's expiry timer has not yet started, this command does not
  affect the given job:

    > !expire 5sid4pgxkiu6zynhbt3q1gi2s
    < Job 5sid4pgxkiu6zynhbt3q1gi2s does not yet have an expiry timer.

  This is intended to prevent expiration of active jobs.


* !status: print job summary

    > !status
    < Job status: 0 completed, 0 aborted, 0 in progress, 0 pending


* !status IDENT, !status URL: print information about a job or URL

    For an unknown job:
    > !status 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b
    < Sorry, I don't know anything about job 1q2qydhkeh3gfnrcxuf6py70b.

    For a URL that hasn't been archived:
    > !status http://artscene.textfiles.com/litpacks/
    < http://artscene.textfiles.com/litpacks/ has not been archived.

    For a URL that hasn't been archived, but has children that have been
    processed before (either succesfully or unsuccessfully):
    > !status http://artscene.textfiles.com/
    < http://artscene.textfiles.com/ has not been archived.
    < However, there have been 5 download attempts on child URLs.
    < More info: http://www.example.com/#/prefixes/http://artscene.textfiles.com/

    For an ident or URL that's in progress:
    > !status 43z7a11vo6of3a7i173441dtc
    <
    < Downloaded 10.01 MB, 2 errors encountered
    < More info at my dashboard: http://www.example.com
